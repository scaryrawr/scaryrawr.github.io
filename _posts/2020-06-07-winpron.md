One subreddit I tend to browse a lot is [r/UnixPorn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/).

I like to switch between Windows and Linux laptops throughout the day, but recently I received a new laptop from work which has kind of inspired me to try getting the same level of theming on Windows that we have on Linux.

With that! Introducing [winwal](https://github.com/scaryrawr/winwal)!

Winwal is just a wrapper on [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal), which is a tool for generating color themes from images. Not only does pywal generate these themes, but it provides support for users to create custom templates. Winwal really is just taking advantage of the custom templates and automating updating tools using the generated themes. Then we use [ColorTool](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/introducing-the-windows-console-colortool/) to apply the theme to Windows Console and update your [Windows Terminal Settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/customize-settings/color-schemes) file directly.

Other benefits of using pywal is that we get to benefit from other tools that already exist and support it such as VS Code [Wal Theme](https://github.com/dlasagno/vscode-wal-theme).
