Introducing [Spotify Daemon DJ JavaScript](https://github.com/scaryrawr/spotdjs)! (OK... so, the name is actually based on "Spotify Daemon in JavaScript").

SpotDJs is only a controller for Spotify and doesn't actually have the ability to stream music. It's created to pair with something like [librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot). I used to use [spotifyd](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd), but spotifyd has [issues](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd/issues/719) with the latest rust toolchain, and also doesn't have the greatest [MPRIS](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/latest/) integration.

SpotDJs doesn't have support for selecting which device to playback on, so I heavily recommend using something like [Spotify TUI](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui).

One of the super sweet things about this implementation is that it supports Album Art (which the official Linux Spotify client... [doesn't do](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Desktop-Linux/Album-art-missing-from-notifications/td-p/4924475).)!

The setup is kind of complicated, try following the [README](https://github.com/scaryrawr/spotdjs/blob/main/README.md) and log any issues as needed.
