  <p>Howdy! I'm Mike Wallio. I'm a Software Developer at Microsoft.</p>
  <p>
    The thoughts and projects here are based on my own opinions and are geared
    towards my own personal endeavors. I'm an avid magic player, and passionate
    about learning and software development. So, my projects will probably deal
    with magic, as well as stuff I'm learning, or things I feel confident in
    teaching.
  </p>
  <p>So thanks for stopping by and reading!</p>
